## Customer Satisfaction Scores
The project is a Customer Satisfaction Prediction System designed to estimate a customer's satisfaction score based on their demographics and behavioral factors. The system leverages a machine learning model trained on historical customer feedback, including features such as age, income, product quality ratings, service quality, purchase frequency, gender, loyalty level, and other relevant attributes. The user interface allows businesses or analysts to input customer information, and the underlying model predicts the Satisfaction Score in real time, helping identify areas for improvement and tailor personalized experiences.
